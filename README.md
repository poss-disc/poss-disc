Hello. I am Redouane Emrani. I am 14 years old, currently learning C as my first programming language, I played with python but I felt that it was not serious so I actually wanted something challenging. I am building my own programming language named remr as an opportunity to learn. I want to learn cybersecurity specialized in red teaming to be more precised. Thank you for reading.
